/**
 * What the instance settings *are*, described rather than drawn.
 *
 * The web interface has its own form for these - six hundred lines of it - and a
 * native client cannot use any of that. The obvious answer was to write the same
 * form again in Swift, which is thirty fields spelled out a second time, wrong
 * the first day somebody adds a thirty-first.
 *
 * So this file says what each setting is - a name, a kind, its choices, what it
 * means - and both the API and anything reading the API work from that. Adding a
 * setting here puts it in the app; nothing else has to know.
 *
 * Deliberately not the storage. Settings live in the `settings` table and are read
 * with setting() and written with set_setting(), which logs the change. This is a
 * description of them, and it holds no values.
 */

/**
 * Every setting the API will hand out or accept, in sections.
 *
 * Kinds:
 *   text      a line of text
 *   url       the same, checked as an address
 *   int       a whole number, with min and max
 *   bool      "1" or "" in the table, true or false over the wire
 *   select    one of `options`, which are value => label
 *   secret    a password. Never sent back; sending one replaces it, and sending
 *             null clears it.
